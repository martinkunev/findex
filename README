Database storing information about files

library for interaction with the database
library for retrieving file information

application that updates the database (can work as a daemon)
application that retrieves information about a file
application that searches in the database

file information:
	name
	mode
	content
	size
	mtime
	preview (thumbnail, etc.)

<name> is a simple collection of tools for searching and file metadata lookup. It uses a file-based database. It consists of two applications:
findex - Traverses the filesystem and stores file metadata in the database.
ffind - Finds files in the database, based on filtering criteria.

<name> is in an early stage of development. It works but there is a lot more work to be done.

//

<name> is created for several reasons:
* to overcome the problems of tools like locate and slocate
  - locate is prone to privilege escalation attacks because it runs with SUID
  - regular users can only use locate's database through locate; this leads to various issues when an application wants to perform indexed search
  - locate provides only filename information and supports only search by filename
  - regular users can't update the database of locate
* to provide a database for fast lookup of file information
	// TODO blog post

usage:
* search tools
* file managers
* servers that need fast lookup of file information (http, etc.)

TODO library
TODO performance imporvements (more sophisticated database; database modification instead of generating a new database; etc.)
TODO compression to reduce file size?
TODO inotify
TODO run the indexing with high nice
TODO don't index when on battery

notable alternatives: recoll, metatracker, mdfind, strigi

TODO reference the blogpost about file types

----

one database for each user in ~/.cache/filement
each user can set up a list of directories to be indexed

filenames in the database must be stored in UTF-8
command line filenames must be passed as UTF-8

format
// only the lowest 7 bits are significant; the highest bit is set for legacy formats

format and layout numbers are not yet fixed (they may change in the future)


file types
* text
	first byte: everything except \x00
	source code
		//
		/*
		--
		{-
		#!
		<!DOCTYPE
		<?xml
		<?php
		<?
		<html
		<xml
		;
		{"
		{
		[
		etc.

types are transparent when it comes to compression

example queries:
* find all html documents
* find all images
* find all songs
* find all movies
* find all archives
* find all documents
