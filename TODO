Redesign file content values and handling

Use a more sophisticated database. Goals:
	easy modification
	fast search
	store bigger data (like file preview for images and audio)
	library providing API for the database

Configuration file for findex
	indicate what to index

Make it possible to run indexing as a deamon (and use inotify, etc.)
	maybe don't index when on battery

findex should work with higher nice

Document how to put findex in crontab
