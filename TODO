update year to 2018

logging for findex

move database management into a library so that it can be used externally
document the library

0.3.0

database compression

use magic file from file

integrate into some file manager

more indices

support large filesize for path index

----

Redesign file content values and handling

command line tool named fstat or ffile
	shows information about the file from the database; uses the same API that a file manager would

Use a more sophisticated database. Goals:
	easy modification
	fast search
		can be accomplished with an index
	store bigger data (like file preview for images and audio)
	library providing API to the database

	first step: add indices for fast search; create API

Configuration file for findex
	indicate what to index

Make it possible to run indexing as a deamon (and use inotify, etc.)
	maybe don't index when on battery

support multiple search locations for ffind

language-specific non-exact search (maybe with libicu)

support mtime search

implement -maxdepth

probably * wildcard should not match initial .
support [] wildcard
