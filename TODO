Redesign file content values and handling

Use a more sophisticated database. Goals:
	easy modification
	fast search
	store bigger data (like file preview for images and audio)
	library providing API to the database

	first step: add indices for fast search; create API

Configuration file for findex
	indicate what to index

Make it possible to run indexing as a deamon (and use inotify, etc.)
	maybe don't index when on battery

support multiple search locations for ffind

language-specific non-exact search

support mtime search

implement -maxdepth

probably * wildcard should not match initial .
support [] wildcard
