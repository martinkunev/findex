consider which of these conversions should be done

* letter case should be taken into account
note: case can have semantic value (especially in german)
note: turkish has different mappings for latin letters: İ -> i; I -> ı

* ligatures
example: œ -> oe, ß -> ss

* diacritics
example: é, è, ê -> e, ç -> c, ѝ -> и, ё -> е
note: diacritics are sometimes used to distinguish words (e.g. sur <-> sûr)

* context-sensitive letters
example: ς -> σ
this is very important for arabic

* country-specific differences
colour -> color; grey -> gray
note: i guess there are problems of the same nature which are more complex

* arabic and non-arabic numbers in some languages

* writing reforms
oignon -> ognon
